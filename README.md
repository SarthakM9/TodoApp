# TodoApp

TodoApp is an android app that allows building a todo list and basic todo items management functionality including adding new items, editing and deleting an existing item.

This app was submitted for **CodePath** prework.

I won't be adding any new features but I would be more than happy to fix any issues and accept pull requests.

## User Stories

* [x] User can successfully add and remove items from the todo list
* [x] User can tap a todo item in the list and bring up an edit screen for the todo item and then have any changes to the text reflected in the todo list.
* [x] User can persist todo items and retrieve them properly on app restart.
* [x] Support for completion due dates for todo items.
* [x] Support for selecting the priority of each todo item.

## Not so common things this app can help you learn

* [x] Compiling and loading libraries only for specific build variants.
* [x] Use of SQLite database using ContentProvider and AsyncQueryHandler
 (although, It can serve as a good example to develop your database layer. But I would now suggest to use **Room** library instead).
* [x] Custom RecyclerView Adapter with Cursor support.
